  <p>The experience of homelessness is heavily concentrated in Scotland, as elsewhere in the UK, on younger age groups (under 45) with relatively few people older people affected. Single working age people and lone parents and at far higher risk of homelessness than other groups in the population.</p>
  <p>Some people experiencing homelessness also experience other problems in their lives, which may be in part a cause of their homelessness, or a consequence of it, and which often complicates the challenge of helping people to move on from homelessness. These problems may include one or more of the following issues: offending; substance misuse/addictions; mental health problems; domestic violence/abuse; as well as homelessness itself. There is evidence of these aspects of complex needs becoming proportionately more prevalent within the statutory homeless population.</p>

      <p>Aberdeen has issues with increasing numbers of EU Nationals with no access to benefits, and there has been an increase in homelessness among people who have no recourse to public funds.</p>
      <p><q>We think rough sleeping largely among our local population is largely, constant, though some people [EU Nationals with no right to accommodation] are excluded from temporary accommodation that were in the city.</q> (Aberdeen, housing)</p>

    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p>In Edinburgh there was strongly acknowledged agreement that homelessness and rough-sleeping has increased lately, with emergency provision struggling to cope.</p>
      <p><q>We see 700 individuals who would otherwise be rough sleeping, using a care shelter over a period of 28 weeks in the winter. Yes, it's in crisis really. The rough sleeping situation, it's just been growing and growing over the recent years. (Edinburgh, voluntary sector)</q></p>

    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p>Although there are some differing views about the overall level of rough sleeping, there is certainly evidence of people with poor experiences of contacting services and <i>falling though the net</i></p>
      <p><q>What I hear more and more often, people telling me there's no point putting a homelessness application in because I'm not going to get accommodated and you lose hope very quickly. (Glasgow, voluntary sector)</q></p>
